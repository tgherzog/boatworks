#### Welcome! ####

Potomac Boatcraft is a startup marine services company
in the northern Virginia and Maryland area
focusing on the repair, renovation, maintainance and makeover of classic
old boats. It's based on my ten years' experience owning and renovating
my own boat, where I discovered that I like renovating boats *almost*
as much as I like sailing them.

If you have a small or large renovation project or you are thinking
of making a few improvements, feel free to [contact me]({{ site.contact.email }})
or check out the [project gallery](gallery.html).
