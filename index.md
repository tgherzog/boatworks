#### Welcome! ####

Potomac Boatcraft is a startup marine services company
in the northern Virginia and Maryland area
focusing on the repair, renovation, maintenance and makeovers of classic
old boats. It's based on my ten years' experience owning and renovating
my own boat, an [Allied Seabreeze 35](http://www.alliedseabreeze35.org/),
including significant projects involving fiberglass repair and fabrication; marine carpentry, gas and electronics systems, and detailing.



If you have a small or large renovation project or you are thinking
of making a few improvements, feel free to [contact me]({{ site.contact.email }})
or check out the [project gallery](gallery.html) and [recent projects](projects.html).
