title: "Refinishing Cockpit Tables"
---

A client and good friend asked me to refinish these drop-leaf cockpit tables for their Beneteau 400.
This was a nice project to do over the off-season when it's usually too cold to work outside.

Varnished brightwork can look fantastic, but requires diligent maintenance to keep it in good shape,
typically 2-3 maintenance coats per year for one-part varnishes.
Like many boat owners, these clients didn't want to spend nice summer days varnishing when
they could be sailing. So in addition to get the tabletops back
in shape I wanted to set them up with a low-effort way to keep them looking good in the years to come.

"Initial state of the drop leaves")

The first step was to remove the old, chipped varnish. Initially, I wasn't sure if the teak and
holly surface was a veneer, so I wanted to avoid sanding. Instead I removed the old finish
with a heat gun and scraper.

"The old varnish came off quite well using a heat gun and scraper")

Once I got down to bare wood it appeared that the center section had been damaged by some sort of oil
(food, engine lubricant, who knows) that left a dark, spotted stain beneath the varnish. Fortunately,
an application of oxalic acid dissolved in water removed the stain almost completely.

"Stripping the varnish from the center section showed some wood damage from some sort of oil. Oxalic acid worked nicely in this case")

Once the tops were fully scraped, cleaned and *lightly* sanded, I applied my "go to" one-part varnish: [Epifanes clear][epifanes].
Epifanes is not the easiest choice for maintenance coats (more on that in a bit), but it provides
a warm, durable, high-gloss finish that levels out nicely. I thinned the first 3 coats as instructed
to seal the wood and applied 4 additional full-strength top coats.

The clients preferred a satin finish instead of the high-gloss Epifanes, and they were looking for
something that would be easy to maintain during season. I had been experimenting with a water-based
varnish from Jamestown Distributors called [Halcyon][halcyon], available in both gloss and satin finishes.
Halcyon dries quickly (about an hour at 72&deg; F) and you
can overcoat without sanding. Jamestown claims you can apply up to 5 coats per day.
By comparison, Epifanes requires 24 hours between coats with sanding in between.
Additionally, Halcyon comes in an innovative tetrapak container. In theory, this reduces waste by
letting you pour out just what you need, then squeeze the air out so that the varnish in the
package doesn't skin over. One of my pet peeves is that the last third of a can of varnish seems
to always spoil in the can, so this is a nice feature. I wish all varnishes came this way.

I decided to apply 2 final coats of Halcyon Satin to provide the desired finish and set
up the owners with a low-maintenance option. My theory here is that reducing the tedium
of varnish maintenance makes it less likely that boat owners will put it off until it's too late.
And laying down 2-3 seasonal coats in a single afternoon is a lot easier than having to do that
same work over 3 days with sanding in between.

Here are the finished sections installed back in the cockpit.

### Important Postscript ###

A [comprehensive varnish comparison](2022-11-02-varnish-smackdown.html) I did
during the 2022 season showed that Halcyon provides surprisingly poor UV protection
over time. Fortunately there are one-part polyeurethane alternatives (including [Gleam][gleam] and [Lust][lust])
that so far provide very good
UV protection, dry nearly as quickly, and allow multiple coats per day without sanding. I've recommended
the client switch to [Gleam 2.0][gleam] for maintenance coats. The only downside is that Gleam and Lust
don't come in tetrapak containers.
