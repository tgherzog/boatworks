title: Ugh! There's an UGLY Hole in My Transom
---

I was still basking in the glow of my [freshly painted hull][hull-repaint]
when I noticed a faint but telltale crack in the paint, right down
the center of the transom. Ugh, I thought; that can't be good.
My memory went back to when I was sanding and fairing the hull, prior
to painting. Right behind that crack in the paint was a fiberglass
repair that had seemed stable, but apparently was not. I would have
to sand back all my hard work and investigate.

A bit of sanding quickly revealed the fiberglass repair right where I
remembered it.

That looked like some sort of fiberglass filler. Well, okay, no problem.
I would simply sand out the filler, expand the area to a beveled "trench" and patch it again,
this time with a few strips of cloth to strengthen and stabilize the repair.

So I started sanding with the goal of removing all of that old filler. I sanded, and sanded,
and sanded some more. The old filler was coming out easily, but so was a lot of beat up
fiberglass. By the time I got back to solid substrate I had sanded a hole straight
through the transom and into the lazarette.

Damn it.

Fortunately, I had plenty of exopy and several weights of cloth. I would
normally want to do a two-sided repair for something like this, building up fiberglass layers from both
the inside (the lazarette) and the outside. However, the inside was inaccessible because of an additional
fiberglass barrier. This would have to be a one-side repair.

After sanding a beveled "tab" on both sides of the crack, I applied about 5 layers of cloth and epoxy thickened
slightly with fumed silica to keep it from running down the vertical surface. I generally follow
[Andy Miller's approach][andy] where smaller cloth pieces go on first, which
puts the most layers of cloth in contact with the substrate.

The resulting repair looked like this:

"This repair consists of about five layers of cloth and epoxy resin, thickened slightly with fumed silica")

Next, I sanded the repair smooth and faired with [Total Fair][totalfair], which mixes to green:

At this point I would ordinarily clean the surface and start repainting. But old fiberglass is particularly
prone to pinholes, and I knew from the previous paint job that any surface sanding would expose
plenty of them. They might not be very visible in the substrate, but a quick coat of white primer
would make them painfully obvious: 

![One coat of primer to identify pin holes](images/transom-patch/one-coat-primer-web.jpg
"A coat of white, two-part primer is a quick way to find pin holes")

I was expecting a handful, of pinholes, but not this many! To fix them, I gouge out as many as
I can find with a sharp blade. Even in this small area there were hundreds.

"There were a lot of pin holes!")

As before, I filled the pin holes with Total Fair, which I applied simply by pressing a small
amount into each divot and leaving it proud. Here is the surface before and after sanding,
which of course removed quite a bit of the previous coat of primer.

"And again after another round of sanding")

Fixing pin holes is a bit of a catch 22. Sanding the fairing compound typically exposes yet more pin holes,
which aren't visible until you apply fresh primer. So I actually did a couple of rounds of primer application
followed by pin hole grinding, fairing and sanding, until all identified pin holes were filled
and a first primer coat didn't reveal any more.

Finally, I applied two additional coats of primer and several coats of topcoat to finish the job.
