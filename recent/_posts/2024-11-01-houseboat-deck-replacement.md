By the end of the 2024 season I finished the latest of my major houseboat deck
projects. Many houseboats from the 1970’s and 1980’s were constructed much like
land-based houseboats, e.g., studs and deck joists on 16” centers, sheathed
with plywood and covered with a weather-resistant laminate (formica was common
back in the day) or fiberglass. Unfortunately, construction materials and
techniques weren’t always marine grade, and when cracks or leaks develop they
can cause significant damage and loss of structural integrity. What on the
surface looks like a small area of damage can often be just the tip of the
iceberg. The owner might not appreciate how significant the issue is until
water starts pouring into the cabin or the galley.

These two projects are typical of the kinds of issues I’ve seen recently.

## 1980s Hilburn 54  ##

This project began with what presented as a 4-inch crack in the fiberglass
exterior of the top deck of a 16’-wide houseboat. The owner had temporarily
covered the crack with duct tape until a repair could be undertaken.

The top decks on Hilburn houseboats are constructed of 3/4" plywood atop joists
running from port to starboard on 16” centers. The seams between plywood
sections are not necessarily sealed or reinforced, and as a result they can
move against each other, particularly if the decks are used for parties or other entertainment.
This can cause the fiberglass to crack
along the seams, letting water get in and cause rot to the plywood, the joists,
and more. Improperly sealed fasteners screwed into the decking are another
common point of water ingress. It doesn’t help that the original construction
often used rust-prone steel staples or even conventional nails, sometimes galvanized,
sometimes not.

By the time the owner notices something is wrong the damage can be extensive.
And once you start exposing the damaged deck, there’s little choice but to keep
going until you reach solid substrate. Until the fiberglass and decking is revealed, it’s
difficult to forecast how large the repair area will eventually be.

In this first case the initial area looked to be about 14” wide and 40” long. This was
estimated by “sounding” the deck, i.e. tapping it with the back of a
screwdriver or ball peen hammer and listening for the desired sharp report or
dreaded dull thud.

Cutting away the fiberglass over this area exposed plywood
that was the consistency of wet cardboard, easily removed with just my hands.

  "Removing the fiberglass from the initial area exposed plywood with the consistency of wet cardboard")


I continued to cut away fiberglass and plywood until the substrate was dry and
solid, being sure---in the bow-stern direction---to end on the middle of a dry and
solid joist so that the replacement decking would be well supported. Typically this means
that the total repair area is at least 1-2 feet larger than the damaged area on each side.

In this case the total area to be replaced was just over 36” wide and 64” long.
Beneath the plywood lay conventional fiberglass bat insulation which had soaked
up a lot of water and had to be replaced.

  "Here is the total repair area after cutting back to solid substrate and beyond to the next available joist. The total area here is just over 36&quot; wide and 64&quot; long")

The next step was to address rot in the joist timbers. They were clearly not a
marine-grade lumber: mostly likely construction-grade pine or similar. Thankfully the
rot was not terribly deep. I ground
out as much as I could and treated the rest with a penetrating epoxy. Then
I cut lengths of marine-grade white oak to “sister” the joists where they
might be weak. After replacing the insulation with rigid foam, I cut a piece of
replacement decking (3/4" marine grade Douglas Fir), sealed the edges with a
flexible epoxy, and fiberglassed over the new floor area. After some fairing, I
applied primer followed by Interdeck non-skid paint.

## 1987 Hilburn 50 ##

The next season brought what looked to be a similar project, and I initially
went about it the same way, exposing the apparent damage area towards the stern
of the sky bridge and working outward from there. However, it wasn’t long
before I realized the damage was much more extensive than I had hoped.

As mentioned previously, it’s often not until you dig into a project like this
that you can fully identify what’s really underneath the surface. But once you
start, you’ve pretty much committed to do whatever it reasonably takes to
repair the damage. Early on I could already see the damage was extensive,
including not only rotted joists and decking but the outer port-side frame of the top deck.
I could also see that a previous owner had attempted a limited repair at an
earlier point. What I didn’t know is how much more rot lay beneath the deck
area that I hadn’t removed yet, particularly along that outer frame. Going further
would mean not only removing and replacing additional plywood deck, but the 12”
overhang on the port side, which would expand the project scope substantially.

![partially demolished fly bridge deck](images/hilburn/brown-partial-demo-web.jpg
  "Even after a few hours work the water damage along the port side was looking pretty bad")

So I stopped at this point and gave the client some options. Under a limited
option, I could stop demolition at this point, replace or reinforce the rotted
beams, joists and plywood for something close to my original estimate. The new
deck would be weatherproof, but not structurally sound, and I would not
recommend using it for entertaining. The second option was to keep going with
the goal of addressing all the structural issues, hoping for the best but
prepared for a much larger and more expensive repair. We had already ruled out
a complete deck replacement as unfeasible given the limits of working outside
and in the slip. The client chose to go for the second option.

The outer frame on the port side turned out to be rotted for almost 16 feet.
In the picture below, the two owls mark the "initial" area that soundings identified
as "soft".

  "Here is the total repair area. The &quot;initial&quot; area is roughly marked by the two owls.")

Furthermore, water had penetrated the end grain of the plywood sheath that comprised the port
exterior wall. This could not be replaced without disassembling the entire side
of the boat, so I’d need to think of something else.

![close up of the rotted exterior deck frame](images/hilburn/brown-frame-rot-web.jpg
  "A close-up of the rotted edge of the top deck's frame. This is supposed to be what supports the
  load of the deck, but in most places it was completely rotted through.")


But first I needed to add jack stands throughout the length of the houseboat
cabin, since there was little to no roof support on the port side. 10 or so
2x4” studs cut to length with protective carpet fragments did the trick.

With better supports in place I proceeded to treat the rotted areas of the
horizontal joists. I ground out as much as I could with a belt sander,
soaked the remaining areas with antifreeze, and filled some of the weakest
areas with a penetrating epoxy. Then I “sistered” the compromised joists with
fresh Doug Fir 2x4” and 2x6” lengths.

With the floor joists still in place, I set about removing the rotted timber on
the port side. I replaced it with the longest 2x4” Doug Fir lengths I could
find, and reattached the joists using [stainless steel joist hangers][hangers].

  "The deck structure with the replaced outer deck frame and reinforced joists, fastened with 316 s/s joist hangers.")


Once the deck was structurally sound I turned to the rotted sections of the port
wall. The original material here was 3/4" plywood with some sort of exterior
laminate on both sides, possibly formica. I’m guessing the plywood was not
marine grade given the extent of rot, but the laminate layers were still in
decent shape. Since replacing the entire wall was not an option, I scraped out
was much of the rotted plywood as I could, and cut a set of replacement plywood
fragments to fill the empty spaces. Then I filled the gap with thickened epoxy,
coated the fragments with more epoxy, dropped them in place, and
clamped the whole wall tight. It was sort of like building a sandwich from the outside in.
Like a pita sandwich perhaps.

  "Here you can see gaps in the outside wall there the plywood had rotted through.
  Replacement plywood fragments lay just to the right, cut to approximate the gaps they would fill.")


Here’s what the wall looked like after the epoxy cured. Afterwards, I added 1x4”
lengths of Doug Fir so that the deck frame would be level with the wall.

  "Here is the wall with replacement fragments glassed in place and sanded smooth.")

With the home stretch finally in sight, the next step was to reinsulate the
roof—this time with rigid foam insulation—cut and install marine-grade plywood
decking, and lay up 2 layers of 20oz fiberglass.

![Deck with insulation](images/hilburn/brown-reinsulated-web.jpg
  "Things are starting to look better with replacement insulation in place. Also shown is the 1x4&quot; plank
  to make the deck level with the port exterior wall.")


The fiberglass part was a bit tricky because the summer of 2024 was especially
hot, and the area to be glassed was over 80 square feet. No matter how early I
started and using slow cure epoxy, the deck was already getting too hot by
10:30am. I ended up doing the lay up in three sections over three days. To
avoid seams, I offset the top layer of cloth by about 2” so that the next day’s
lay up could dovetail with the current one without creating noticeable seams.
It worked sort of like a lap joint would.

  "Deck cut to its final shape with finished edges and two layers of 20oz fiberglass.")

The final structural detail was to add the 3/4" lip around the edge of the new
deck. Unlike the original, I cut several drains into the lip so that water
would drain off the top deck instead of puddling where it might cause future issues.

Here is the finished project after topside and non-skid paint, and reinstalling
the deck walls and bimini frame.
