title: Installation
---

We planned to do the port and starboard rail installation in 3 steps:

1. Test fit to mark the location of fasteners holes, check the mating of the toe rail to the hull,
   and drill fastener holes in the rails
2. Dry fit the rail to the hull and drill fastener holes through the deck
3. Apply sealant and complete final fit and installation

## Test fit ##

At this point the goals are to make sure there aren't any serious high or low spots in how the rail
mates with the deck, as well as to mark the locations of the fastener holes in the toe rails. Except
for some reinforcement at the bow and in the area of the genoa track, the old rails had fasteners about
every 14 inches, so we decided to stick with that.

Before doing the test fit I went below and meticulously recorded the relative location of every bulkhead
or other obstruction. I then marked these locations on deck so we wouldn't inadvertently position a
through bolt where we wouldn't be able to secure it from below.

Next, we fit the rail to the deck. I held one of the rail while my friend Pete held the other end
so that just a short section rested on deck and any point, sort of like a tangent line on
an arc. Sonny worked on deck to mark spots that didn't fit well on either the deck or hull side.
Then we dropped the rail back to the ground, planed and/or sanded as necessary to level out the
uneven spots, and measured again.

Finally, we marked the location of the fastener holes in the top of the rail, making sure to avoid
bulkheads and other obstructions. We used a tabletop drill press to get nice, straight holes (I don't
trust myself using a handheld drill for this), and a
high-quality counterbore bit with a 1/4" pilot bit sized to fit our fasteners.
The bow-most piece required some adjustments on the drill press
because the profile is angled out at that point, and the larger timber requires longer bolts.

The genoa track was a bit of an exception. My track takes 3/16" flathead machine bolts every 4", no forstner bit,
but countersunk for whatever sealant goes between the track and the toe rail (we're planning on using
[butyl tape](https://shop.marinehowto.com/products/bed-it-tape) to seal the track).
