title: Removing the old toe rails
published: true

The first step of course is to remove the existing toe rails. Ideally, I wanted to remove
these as intact as possible to use them as templates for the new rails as I really wanted
to keep the same basic profile. I was initially worried that would prove difficult. I had
nightmares of bent, stripped and broken fasteners that would need to be sawn through or
worse.

In the end, toe rail removal wasn't nearly as much of a nightmare as I feared, and we were
able to do much of it working solo. Most of the fasteners came out fairly clean, and
once that was accomplished, steady pressure on the rails was enough to break the bond
of the sealant. This was made easier by the fact that the rails were already quite rotten
in several places.

Before starting the removal, it's a good idea to take a good set of pictures to documemt
the project. Especially note the position of any hardware attached to the rails: genoa
tracks, blocks, chocks, strakes, etc, as well as any scuppers (although if you have ever
thought of repositioning any of these, now is the time). Also note the approximate spacing
of the existing rail fastener bolts. In the case of the Allied Seabreeze the bolts on the original
[massive teak toe rails](http://www.alliedseabreeze35.org/files/Download/Allied%20Hull%20to%20Deck%20Joint.pdf)
are spaced 7" apart.

The most tedious and time consuming part of the toe rail removal stage is getting access to the several dozen nuts
that secure the bolts beneath the deck. At 7" intervals, there are approximately 60 of these per side
plus the transom plus additional bolts to secure rail-mounted hardware. I had to completely empty the lockers,
lazarette and anchor chain locker, and temporarily remove several sections of panelling in the cabin.
Other systems may also need to be temporarily relocated or removed. This is an excellent time to
remove obsolete systems and wiring that long ago you or a previous owner decided to simply disconnect rather
than remove entirely, inspect and/or service hard to reach systems, etc.
In my case I got rid of a non-functional battery charger, internal phone wiring, inverter,
bilge blower and several yards of electrical wiring that had just been snipped and left in place.
This by itself was a satisfying experience, albeit time consuming. For systems that you want to keep, be sure
to document the parts you are removing as well as their fasteners. It may be some time before you reach
the point where these can be reinstalled.

The toe rail fasteners were covered by covered by wooden plugs or bungs, which were easy to
identify by sight. We started by chiseling these out to expose the bolt heads beneath. If Sonny was working
with me, he would hold the screw heads in place with a screwdriver while I went below and removed the nuts
with an impact driver or crescent wrench (or I would hold the nut while he removed the screw from above).
If I was working solo, I would hold the nut in place with grip-lock pliers, then remove the bolt from above.
Of course it's important to tie off the pliers so they don't fall into the bilge when the screw gives way :)

With the fasteners removed, we just broke the sealant bond by gently lifted off the rails in pieces. Several
of the scarf joints had already softened which made it easy to remove the rails in large sections.

We labelled each piece and took the set back to Sonny's shop to keep as a reference for a while.

Back at the boat yard, the removed toe rails left behind the exposed sealant, a thick, rubbery substance that
I removed with a paint scraper.

We guessed this was either 3M 101, which has been discontinued, or Sikaflex. In my case
the deck paint beneath the rails was already in rough shape and would need to be repainted,
so I didn't mind being overly aggressive to get all the old sealant off.
