title: Deck repair and preparation
---

The removal of the toe rails exposed hundreds of fastener holes in the deck: way more than could
be accounted for by the fasteners we'd just removed. These were mostly in the area
of the genoa track, suggesting that at one point the track had been replaced, new mounting
drilled, and the previous holes left as they were. Understandable, but... yikes! We briefly
considered reusing the same mounting holes as the previous toe rail/genoa track used to
avoid drilling yet another set of holes in the deck, but quickly decided this was foolhardy.
It would have required drilling mount holes for the new toe rails from beneath the deck
during the dry fit, which I doubt would have been possible (too many locations are inaccessible
with power tools) and in any case would have taken much longer. By contrast, it's easy to
fill the old holes with epoxy and start fresh.

To fill the old fastener holes we mixed epoxy with a generous amount of fumed silica to about a mayonnaise
thickness. Sonny has this neat trick were he filled a plastic sandwich bag with epoxy and cut a small
corner to squeeze the epoxy out like an icing bag. I taped the holes from beneath to keep the epoxy
from dripping into the cabin and holds, so this step went pretty quick. And even though the finished
rail project was still a long way off, this step was a huge step in solving a lot of those "mystery leaks"
that had been plaguing me for years.

The other deck-related issue involved the deck-to-hull joint. The Seabreeze design employs an
[inboard joint](http://www.alliedseabreeze35.org/files/Download/Allied%20Hull%20to%20Deck%20Joint.pdf) which
has [become standard](https://www.sailmagazine.com/diy/sealing-the-hull-to-the-deck) for boats with toe rails.
As a consequence, the deck is about 5/16" above the hull at the joint, requiring a bevel cut into the bottom
of the toe rail. We briefly considered levelling off the deck to avoid this and make the toe rail fit easier,
but quickly decided it would be easier to tweak the profile of the toe rail (by sanding) than change the profile
of the deck (by epoxy and fairing).

That said, we discovered that the deck-hull joint was not uniformly spaced around the boat; near the bow
it was closer to 5/8" on starboard and early 7/8" on port. It's not clear to me if this was by design or the
result of a repair at some point. Whoever made the previous rails apparently
resolved this by cutting a deeper bevel into the bottom of the rails which tapered to 5/16" as it went aft.
That struck us as too risky; it's one thing to make minor adjustments to the toe rail's profile during the
dry fit. We thought this approach would run the risk of oversanding the rail and ruining some very expensive wood.
Instead, we decided to level off the deck-hull joint at the bow so it was a consistent depth all the way
around.

To begin, Sonny sanded through the paint and gelcoat on the hull side of the joint to expose the fiberglass.
We then made a dam with painter's tape on the hull to keep the epoxy from running off the side. For strength
we cut several strips of fiberglass cloth, which we laid over and pressed into the epoxy as we went (a couple
of layers by my recollection). Once the epoxy cured we removed the painter's tape and sanded the new area
to be level with the existing deck-hull joint.

Afterwards, we faired the hull to make the profile of the modified bow as seamless as possible. This was
about the point in the project where I started to think it was time to repaint the hull anyway ;)
