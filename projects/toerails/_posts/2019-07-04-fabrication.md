title: Toe Rail Fabrication
---

**Note:** the pictures below reflect a somewhat random mix of our work on both
the port and starboard toe rails. In reality we nearly completed (but didn't install)
the port-side rail before starting on starboard, but I was less diligent with my
pictures at first, so I added some starboard shots to fill out the narrative.
{: .note :}

By this point I'd purchased rough teak lumber from the local yard:

* 8 8/4 (just over 2" square) timbers, 8-9' long
* 2 12/4 (3+" square) timbers for the bow, 8-9.5' long
* 1 2x5" timber for the transom

With 8" scarf joints each rail comes out to approximately 38' overall length.

Using the old toe rails as a pattern, we cut the timbers, with the exception of the larger 
bow piece, to 1.875" square on the table saw.

Fabrication presented two major challenges. First, the step in the deck-hull join
required that a bevel be cut into the bottom of each toe rail segment. Whoever did the
old rails actually made a triangular cut into the bottom; we surmised this provided
some breathing room when fitting the rail to the deck, as well as extra clearance for sealant,
so we decided to take the same approach. Again, we used the table saw to make the two
required cuts, one vertical and one with a blade angle of 7 degrees.
Teak sawdust is toxic, so **be sure to wear a respirator mask**.

**Note:** The table saw will throw off lots of fine sawdust: thus the caution about wearing
a mask. But if the sawdust is fine enough and you're careful, you can collect it and use it as
epoxy thickener when you scarf join the segments together.

The second and trickier challenge was the "bow-most" section where the toe rail needed to mate with the casting
at the bow. That meant cutting a plug to fit within the casting in addition to a canted cut that
tapered from the square angles at the stern end of the timbers to a trapezoid at the bow end. This
is why I needed larger timber for the bow piece. And because neither of us had done this before I
also bought a fir 4x4" from the hardware store to do a practice cut and fit.

**Note:** I've become a big fan of practicing various techniques using scrap lumber.
No use making first-time mistakes on expensive teak or mahogany. Same goes for epoxy. Much better to practice
first to get a feel for what you're doing before doing it for real on your boat. Plus, it gives
me something to do in my shop at home during the week when I can't be out at the boat. The caveat
is that because different woods have different densities, a table saw, planer or router will likely perform
quite differently with your production wood than with your practice wood.
{: .note :}

![fir for practice](images/fir-blank-web.jpg "We practiced on a piece of relatively cheap fir before cutting the bow segment from more expensive teak")

We did the canting by penciling a template into the timber (see below), doing some very rough wedge cuts
on the table saw and finer cuts with an electric hand planer, often working on an angle.
On our first rail we forgot to account for
the scarf joint at the stern end, which meant some extra sanding and planing down the line. On the starboard
side we anticipated this a little better.

I learned the hard way not to be overly aggressive with the planer. Electric planers can take off a lot
of wood quickly! Better to go slow and be conservative. It's much easier to lightly sand a bit more wood off later
than to put back what you hastily took off with a planer :)

With the canting roughed out it was time to cut the plug to mate with the casting. This was a slow, manual
process of chiseling away just enough wood to achieve a snug fit, with frequent test fits. I was more than
happy to allow Sonny to work his magic here (plus he has better tools).

As I said, these pictures mix up the port and starboard stages of the project, and hence they aren't in sequence time-wise. Here is a picture
of the roughed-out starboard segment alongside its port counterpart, which has been finish sanded, scarf joined, and drilled with fastener holes
(more on that later).
