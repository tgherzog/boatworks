title: Transom
---

I'd intentionally left the transom for last, in part because I wasn't really sure how
to approach it. I have no experience with steam bending wood, and I wasn't sure if it
would even work in this project given the degree of arc necessary. So I decided to get the
thickest timber I could find/afford, cut the arc, and epoxy together multiple segments.
Because I'd never done this before, I planned on making at least one prototype. 2x6" pine
(actual dimensions are 1.5x5.5") from the hardware store was close enough in dimensions
to my actual teak (2x5") for prototyping and proof of concept.

My first step was to get the dimensions of my transom. At first I tried laying down a
piece of scrap 1/4" plywood to trace the transom from underneath. This didn't turn out
to be terribly helpful. On the somewhat risky assumption that my transom is a perfect geometric
arc, all I really needed was the maximum width of the transom (across
the beam) and the height of the arc: or, if you are a geometrist, the chord and the saggita.
If my assumption wasn't correct... well, that's what
prototypes are for. I measured my transom/chord at 52" with a height/saggita of 6".

Back in my workshop, I made a jig from 1/4" strip to trace an arc of the correct dimensions
onto 1/8" MDF. At this point I wasn't sure how the transom would join with the toe rails
so I actually went several inches wider than what I might need to allow some flexibility.
This would define the outside edge of the transom.

I then drew 3 radii at the ends and middle of my arc (if you've forgotten high school
geometry, [here's how](https://www.mathopenref.com/constcirclecenter.html)),
measured in 2.5" (2" for the width of my transom plus 1/2"), and used the jig to connect
these points to outline the inside edge of the transom. Then I squared off the ends and
cut out the template with a jigsaw. This technique produces an arc of equal thickness; if I just
slid the whole jig down 2.5" the transom would be ever so slightly thicker at the ends.

On my 2x6" I traced out as much of the template as I could fit, cut the residual off at
an angle, and
continued tracing the rest of the template on the second section. These two pieces scarfed
together (with wood glue - no sense in wasting epoxy on a prototype) were sufficient to
fit the entire template.

Once the glue dried, I set my jigsaw to about 14 degrees (approximately the same profile as the 
old transom), rough cut the transom, and cut the bevel into the foot with a handheld router.

The test fit went okay, but not quite right. It turns out my arc measurements were a bit too generous,
and the bevel in the foot wasn't quite generous enough. The angle of my jigsaw also needed to be
greater, at least on the outside. So I marked corrections to cut a second template and try again.

**2nd Attempt:** I reduced the height of the arc to 5.75" and re-cut the MDF template using the technique
above, and checked the template against my transom. The center and the ends of the template lined up well, but
the areas between were still a bit shy. This is where I concluded that the transom isn't a perfect geometric arc.

**3rd Attempt:** this time I actually drew 2 "half arcs" each connecting the center point with one of the ends. This
turned out to be pretty close, so I cut another prototype from scrap timber. I've included the exact dimensions of the
3rd pattern below in case it's helpful, but even if you also have a Seabreeze I suspect you'll also need to make a couple
of test fits before getting the template right.

From this template I cut a new prototype from more scrap lumber (this time using 2x4s with a lot more joints), cutting
at about a 17 degree angle with the jigsaw and a bit more aggressive with the router.

One last important detail: so far my prototypes have been cut from dimensional lumber which is 1.5" thick while my final rails
are 2" thick. I have two chocks that mount on the transom piece, and the Seabreeze
transom has a pronounced taper. The closer the fastener holes for the chocks come to the stern, the more difficult they will be
to fasten from within the lazarette. A beveled toerail piece makes this problem worse by pushing the mounting holes farther astern,
and thicker (taller) rails even worse. So to ensure I'm leaving sufficient clearance for hardware, I cut a pair of risers from 1/2" MDF
wide enough to mount my chocks and increase the transom thickness to 2".

The 3rd test fit looked very good overall, but those chock mount bolts will definitely be a problem. If I want to keep the bevel, I either
need to pull the transom piece inward or make it slightly thicker, perhaps an additional 1/2".
