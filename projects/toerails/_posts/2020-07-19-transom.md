title: Transom
---

The transom posed a particular set of challenges. Having no experience in steam
bending, I was reluctant to try to steam a straight rail to such a tight arc.
Instead, I found some wider (2" x 5") teak lumber which I planned to cut and 
epoxy into a rough "V" and cut the transom piece using a template. As with the
bow section, I figured it was best to first template this using cheap timber 2x6"
from the big box store.


My first step was to get the dimensions of my transom. At first I tried laying down a
piece of scrap 1/4" plywood to trace the transom from underneath. This didn't turn out
to be terribly helpful. Instead, I assumed that the transom was close to a geometric
arc and measured its width and height (or in geometric terms, its chord and saggita).
I measured the transom at 52" wide (the chord) and 6" high (the saggita).


Back in my workshop, I made a jig from 1/4" strip to trace an arc of the correct dimensions
onto 1/8" MDF. At this point I wasn't sure how the transom would join with the toe rails
so I actually went several inches wider than what I might need to allow some flexibility.
This would define the outside edge of the transom.

I then drew 3 radii at the ends and middle of my arc (if you've forgotten high school
geometry, [here's how](https://www.mathopenref.com/constcirclecenter.html)),
measured in 2.5" (2" for the width of my transom plus 1/2" for the bevel cut), and used the jig to connect
these points to outline the inside edge of the transom. Then I squared off the ends and
cut out the template with a jigsaw. This technique produces an arc of equal thickness; if I just
slid the whole jig down 2.5" the transom would be ever so slightly thicker at the ends.

On my 2x6" I traced out as much of the template as I could fit, cut the residual off at
an angle, and
continued tracing the rest of the template on the second section. These two pieces glued
together were sufficient to fit the entire template.

Once the glue dried, I set my jigsaw to about 14 degrees (approximately the same profile as the 
old transom), rough cut the transom, and cut the bevel into the foot with a handheld router.

The test fit went okay, but not quite right. It turns out my arc measurements were a bit too generous,
and the bevel in the foot wasn't quite generous enough. The angle of my jigsaw also needed to be
greater, at least on the outside. So I marked corrections to cut a second template and try again.

**2nd Attempt:** I reduced the height of the arc to 5.75" and re-cut the MDF template using the technique
above, and checked the template against my transom. The center and the ends of the template lined up well, but
the areas between were still a bit shy. Perhaps the transom isn't a geometric arc after all, at least not
in a practical sense.

**3rd Attempt:** this time I actually drew 2 "half arcs" each connecting the center point with one of the ends. This
turned out to be pretty close, so I cut another prototype from scrap timber. I've included the exact dimensions of the
3rd pattern below in case it's helpful.

From this template I cut a new prototype from more scrap lumber (this time using 2x4s with a lot more joints), cutting
at about a 17 degree angle with the jigsaw and a bit more aggressive with the router.

With the transom's basic profile worked out, my next step was to work out how the holes for the fastener bolts would
be determined. This was a tricky issue given the sharp angle of the Seabreeze transom, which leaves little room
beneath deck for the bolts. I also needed to allow for a pair of stern line chocks shown in the picture below. The chocks
ruled out any ideas about "fudging" the angle of the fastener bolts; they would have to be perpendicular to the top
of the transom toerail section for the chock bolts to mate correctly.
As shown in the picture, the chocks were previously mounted on risers, possibly to deal with these very clearance issues,
but I wanted to avoid that hack if possible and mount them directly to the rails.

![original transom with chocks](images/original-transom-with-chocks-web.jpg "The original transom with chocks for stern lines. I wanted to avoid the risers if possible")

Before cutting the actual teak I took careful measurements of the deck, the deck-hull join, and the angle of the
transom (almost exactly 45 degrees). The thickness of both the deck and the hull were also factors.
To estimate the thickness of the hull I measured
the distance from one of my stanchion bolts to the edge of the deck, both above and below deck, and took the difference.

Then I fed my measurements into an illustration program to produce this diagram on top of a 1/8" grid. This is exactly
to scale, including the widths and lengths of the fastener bolts (deck-hull fasteners in orange, transom fasteners in blue).
On my boat, the cable clam is the deck fitting that comes closest to the toerail so I added it for reference.

This gave me a way to play around with both the width and position of the transom prior to
doing actual cuts on my teak timber. I decided to make the transom toerail 2 1/8" wide (1/8" wider than the port and
starboard sections) to so that the fastener bolts could be positioned just a bit further away from the edge of the
hull but still be centered. Still, there would be very little clearance for the fastener bolts, particularly those
for the chocks, and I expected I would have to cut those four bolts slightly shorter.

With that out of the way it was time to (finally!) cut the final transom. I started by
cutting the 2x5" timber at an angle and gluing it into the "V" I would need using epoxy thickened with teak sawdust.

Once that cured, I simply laid the MDF template on top of the timber and traced it out:

![!transom with template](images/transom-final-with-template-web.jpg 'Transom with the MDF template')

Then I cut the timber with a jigsaw set to a 14-degree angle (more or less). I also did a bit of finish sanding,
including rounding off the top edges, although I didn't take pictures of this step.

The transom foot would need a cutout to account for the deck-hull join shown in the illustration above, leaving about a 3/8"
foot. Unfortunately, I don't have a complete router table and had to make do with my hand-held Dewalt. I already knew from
the prototype that the router could easily slip and cut the wrong way. But fortunately, Dewalt makes this handy edge guide
which would prevent the router from cutting into the foot (slipping and cutting the other way would be fine).
So I broke this task into two parts. First, I used the edge guide to cut a groove parallel to the curve of the transom
that would define the foot. For this I used a 3/8" straight bit and made two passes at 1/8" and 1/4" depths.

![!transom with router and edge guide](images/transom-router-with-guide-web.jpg 'This edge guide prevented the router from slipping away from me and cutting into the foot')

The groove gave me a safety margin to remove the remaining material without a jig. So I switched to a wider straight bit
set to a 1/4" depth and made lots of small passes over the remaining wood. So long as I worked backwards, the bottom of the transom provided a stable surface for the router, and I marked the top of my router with a piece of masking tape
to remind me where the foot was.

![!transom with router and edge guide](images/transom-router-groove-cut-web.jpg 'The green tape marks the edge of the foot underneath')

Again, working backwards in a zig-zag pattern, I removed the remaining wood in passes of about 1/4" to 3/8" each.

After a bit more sanding, I did a quick test fit on the boat. Here it is from front and behind with a jug of antifreeze to
weight it in place. At first I was worried that it would be too difficult to bend the wood vertically to match the deck,
but a quick "test bend" back at home alleviated my concerns.

**TODO:** confirm the final angle for the jigsaw cut and the depth of the router to cut the foot.
