title: Transom
---

I'd intentionally left the transom for last, in part because I wasn't really sure how
to approach it. I have no experience with steam bending wood, and I wasn't sure if it
would even work in this project given the degree of arc necessary. So I decided to get the
thickest timber I could find/afford, cut the arc, and epoxy together multiple segments.
Because I'd never done this before, I planned on making at least one prototype. 2x6" pine
(actual dimensions are 1.5x5.5") from the hardware store was close enough in dimensions
to my actual teak (2x5") for prototyping and proof of concept.

My first step was to get the dimensions of my transom. At first I tried laying down a
piece of scrap 1/4" plywood to trace the transom from underneath. This didn't turn out
to be terribly helpful. On the somewhat risky assumption that my transom is a symetrical
arc, all I really needed was the maximum width of the transom (across
the beam) and the height of the arc: or, if you are a geometrist, the chord and the saggita.
If my assumption wasn't correct... well, that's what
prototypes are for. I measured my transom/chord at 52" with a height/saggita of 6".

Back in my workshop, I made a jig from 1/4" strip to trace an arc of the correct dimensions
onto 1/8" MDF. At this point I wasn't sure how the transom would join with the toe rails
so I actually went several inches wider than what I might need to allow some flexibility.
This would define the outside edge of the transom.

I then drew 3 radii at the ends and middle of my arc (if you've forgotten high school
geometry, [here's how](https://www.mathopenref.com/constcirclecenter.html)),
measured in 2.5" (2" for the width of my transom plus 1/2"), and used the jig to connect
these points to outline the inside edge of the transom. Then I squared off the ends and
cut out the template with a jigsaw. This technique produces an arc of equal thickness; if I just
slid the whole jig down 2.5" the transom would be ever so slightly thicker at the ends.

On my 2x6" I traced out as much of the template as I could fit, cut the residual off at
an angle, and
continued tracing the rest of the template on the second section. These two pieces scarfed
together (with wood glue - no sense in wasting epoxy on a prototype) were sufficient to
fit the entire template.

Once the glue dried, I set my jigsaw to about 14 degrees (approximately the same profile as the 
old transom), rough cut the transom, and cut the bevel into the foot with a handheld router.

The test fit went okay, but not quite right. It turns out my arc measurements were a bit too generous,
and the bevel in the foot wasn't quite generous enough. The angle of my jigsaw also needed to be
greater, at least on the outside. So I marked corrections to cut a second template and try again.
