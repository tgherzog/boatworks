title: Cockpit Repair
---

As for the cockpit, I'm not really looking for a perfect paint job since the
area in question will be almost entirely covered by the refurbished coamings. My
main concern is that the area be water tight and the surface smooth and durable
enough that I can more easily clean the space between the coaming and the seat.

After cleaning the area (scrub brush, soap and water) I drilled out the old
fastener holes to 3/8" and filled them with thickened epoxy. Oversizing the
holes ensures that the fiberglass has a good seal when I later drill new
1/4" fastener holes. There will also 3-4 spots where the edge formed by the
deck and cockpit had deteriorated allowing water to get behind the coamings,
so I filled those in as well.

With the area cleaned up and sealed, the state of the paint became more
apparent and worrying. I'm not sure why there's so much pocking in the paint
since it's never seen the light of day, but one possible explanation is that
it's the fiberglass underneath that's actually in bad shape. In any case, I
ended up sanding off nearly all the old paint while also sanding over the
epoxy repairs. Sure enough, there were lots of tiny spots where the fiberglass
was chipped away, and I'll need to fix these with epoxy as well.
