title: Winch Blocks
---

Winch blocks weren't part of the original plan. But while fitting the port
coaming Sonny noticed that the standalone starboard winch block had some serious
rot issues of its own. So that would need to be fixed, which would mean removing
the winch, sanding off the old vernish, filling the rot with epoxy, and
resealing. So the winch blocks would have to be part of the refurbishing after
all. It turns out that removing the winch blocks was a lot easier than I thought,
and I decided to refinish all of them. The winches themselves were way past due
to be serviced anyway.

I started by drilling a few holes in a spare 2x4 to match the mount bolts on the
bottom of the winch block. This secured the block firmly so I could go at it
with a power sander.

Next I set about filling in the rotted area with epoxy. This was my first time
using a [low viscocity epoxy](https://www.epoxyusa.com/low_viscosity_epoxy_p/me20.htm)
and I'm still getting used to it. For this job I mixed in a bit of acetone
to encourage it to really soak into the rotted fibers. In hindsight I'm not
sure that was necessary or even a good idea. Even though I taped off the edges
the epoxy still ran everywhere, took *forever* to reach the [green stage](https://www.westsystem.com/instruction-2/epoxy-basics/epoxy-chemistry/),
and well over 24 hours to fully cure. That
could have been because my garage was cold that day, and I moved future epoxy
work to my warmer basement.

Once the low viscocity epoxy had gone green I followed up by filling the rest
of the cavity with regular thickened epoxy.

Meanwhile, I sanded down the much smaller block for the main sheet winch that
mounts against the coaming at the stern of the cockpit next to the mizzen mast.
I did the sanding mostly by hand since the block is much smaller with several
non-uniform surfaces. This is notionally an easier project since there is no rot
to fix. However, the top surface on which the old South Coast winch sat was not fair,
and I wanted to see if I could fix that before resealing the block. The solution
I came up with wasn't especially pretty, but here it is.

First I applied two sealing coats of low V epoxy to the top of the main sheet block, and,
while I was at it, the bottom of the jib sheet block.

Then I took a piece of reasonably fair plywood, coated it with plastic shipping 
tape, and set it level with shims and the level app on my iPhone.

For a mold, I cut off the rim from a lid of one of those quart-sized yogurt
containers, which turn out to be about 1/2" wider than the circular area I was
trying to fair up. I calculated the amount of epoxy necessary to fill this area
to about 1/10" thick, mixed and poured the epoxy into the mold, and topped the mold with
a weight to keep the epoxy from leaking out from underneath.

Next I waited for the epoxy to start to thicken and go a bit green. This only took about 20 minutes
since I was using "fast cure" or winter hardener. I kept a bit of residual epoxy
in the mix cup to swirl around to estimate how the epoxy in the mold was doing.

Once the epoxy got thick enough that it wasn't running, I removed the weight and
the mold, set the winch block firmly upside down in the pool of epoxy, and let
it cure overnight.

The end result wasn't exactly what I hoped for. The epoxy ended up spreading out
more than I hoped, but for the most part kept its shape. I may have been  bit too
generous in how much epoxy to use but better too much than too little in this case.
Fortunately, the top surface underneath the winch was now perfectly fair.
I would just need to knock down the extra bits with a Dremel.

It was as I was waking up the next morning that I realized I had forgotten a step,
which is to countersink the through holes in the top of the winch blocks. These
are necessary because I plan to seal the winch to the block using butyl tape
following [this approach](https://marinehowto.com/bed-it-tape/). Countersinking
at this point would require some triage at this point since the top surface is
already sealed with epoxy. So I countersunk the original holes (drilling through
the epoxy), plugged the holes with 1/4" rubber stoppers (I have a bunch of these
for temporarily plugging holes in my deck), and poured epoxy into the spaces
between the countersink and the stoppers. The rubber doesn't perfectly resist
the epoxy but it's definitely good enough. Once the epoxy cures it's easy to 
drill final countersinks. These I want to sink slightly less than the previous
ones so I don't completely drill through the epoxy, so if you're trying this
technique yourself you might want to go with a slightly deeper set of countersinks
the first time around.

Same process on the larger winch block, except that I remembered to drill countersinks
before applying epoxy.

As a final detail, the larger winch block sported several small stress cracks. Before
sealing the entire block I wanted to fill these in as best I could with more
low V epoxy. For a space this small the best way I've found is to pour small
amounts of  epoxy over the crack and slowly work it in with a toothpick.
