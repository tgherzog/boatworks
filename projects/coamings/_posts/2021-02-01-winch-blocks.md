title: Winch Blocks
---

**Note:** this part of the project wasn't especially smooth or linear, and
in several places I had to double back and correct earlier mistakes. The following
account reflects what I probably *should* have done, and where relevant I've included
notes as to where I initially went wrong.

Winch blocks weren't part of the original plan. But while fitting the port
coaming Sonny noticed that the standalone starboard winch block had some serious
rot issues of its own. So that would need to be fixed, which would mean removing
the winch, sanding off the old vernish, filling the rot with epoxy, and
resealing. So the winch blocks would have to be part of the refurbishing after
all. It turns out that removing the winch blocks was a lot easier than I thought,
and I decided to refinish all of them. The winches themselves were way past due
to be serviced anyway.

I had three objectives mind for the winch blocks:

1. Fix the obvious rot issues and other cracks in the wood
2. Level surfaces where the blocks mate with the deck and winch
3. Seal the wood

I started by drilling a few holes in a spare 2x4 to match the mount bolts on the
bottom of the winch block. This secured the block firmly so I could go at it
with a power sander.

Next I set about filling in the rotted area with epoxy. This was my first time
using a [low viscocity epoxy](https://www.epoxyusa.com/low_viscosity_epoxy_p/me20.htm)
and I'm still getting used to it. For this job I mixed in a bit of acetone
to encourage it to really soak into the rotted fibers. In hindsight I'm not
sure that was necessary or even a good idea. Even though I taped off the edges
the epoxy still ran everywhere, took *forever* to reach the [green stage](https://www.westsystem.com/instruction-2/epoxy-basics/epoxy-chemistry/),
and well over 24 hours to fully cure. That
could have been because my garage was cold that day, and I moved future epoxy
work to my warmer basement.

Once the low viscocity epoxy had gone green I followed up by filling the rest
of the cavity with regular thickened epoxy.

The winch block also had several much smaller stress fractures, so before sealing the wood
it made sense to try to stabilize these with low V epoxy as well.
For a space this small the best way I've found is to pour small
amounts of  epoxy over the crack and slowly work it in with a toothpick.

## Fairing Up the Block Surfaces ##

Both jib winch blocks had "leveling" issues in that both the top and bottom sides had
been rounded off. I'm not sure if they had always been this way or whether I had
inadvertently rounded the surfaces with the sander while removing varnish (I suspect a bit
of both). In any event, the blocks "wobbled" noticably when placed on a fair surface such as
my workbench, as well as the deck. The top surfaces were also irregular, but that wasn't as
much of a concern because they actually mated reasonably with my Harken winches, which are an
older model with an open base design.

To level the bottom sides I set about using the same approach as I took previously with 
the end caps on the coamings; that is, coat the surface with thickened epoxy and press it
flat against a fair surface covered in plastic. The challenge in this
case was that the bottom of the winch blocks featured five holes for the fastener bolts,
and inside each hole was a 1/4" coupling nut that I absolutely did not want to risk exposing
to epoxy. Is there a good way to protect the fastener holes that wouldn't adhere to
the base or affect its level? The best option I could think of was leftover cheese wax,
cheese wax, similar to paraffin, which I used to fill
the fastener holes enough to protect the bolts but not sit too proud of the base. In
hindsight this wasn't a great idea as the wax didn't release well from the epoxy, and
I had to gouge and grind it out. But it served the primary purpose of protecting the couplings, and any
ugliness wasn't a big concern since it wouldn't be visible and the entire surface
would be finally sealed with butyl tape.

I also taped the sides of the block with simple masking tape; I'm not sure why I didn't
use plastic packing tape as it would clearly have been a better choice.

![winch block base](images/winch-block-base2-web.jpg "Covered in a thin skin of epoxy...")

Then I covered the base of the block in a skin of epoxy, enough to just cover the surface
to a depth commensurate with its unevenness, laid it on an epoxy-resistant fair surface,
and waited for it to cure. The first time through I tried clamping the block to a piece
of fair medium density fiberboard (MDF) covered in wax paper. The clamps turned out to be a
mistake that only bent the MDF to fix the rounded
bottom rather than the other way around, and I had to fair the block twice.

![winch block clamped](images/winch-block-clamped-web.jpg "...and set firmly against a fair surface. The clamps are a mistake and I shouldn't have used them")

Here's the finished based of the winch block after I scraped, ground and sanded out the protective wax,
and sanded down the edges where the epoxy seeped out from beneath the base (as with the coaming end cap,
I want a bit of seepage on all sides to ensure the epoxy is level and fully covers the surface).

![winch block sealed](images/winch-block-base-finished-web.jpg "Base with protective wax removed. Not pretty, but effective")

The process for the port block was much the same, except without the initial rot issues.

## Main Sheet Block ##

Meanwhile, I sanded down the much smaller block for the main sheet winch that
mounts against the coaming at the stern of the cockpit next to the mizzen mast.
I did the sanding mostly by hand since the block is much smaller with several
non-uniform surfaces.

The main sheet block turned out to be fairly level on the bottom side that mated
with the deck. However, the top side had been rounded off, and unlike the jib 
winches, my main sheet winch had a solid base that needed a flat surface. But
because this surface would be visible I wanted to use a clear epoxy coat, which
meant thickeners were out. This would need a bit different process.

**Note:** this is one part where the description doesn't match what actually happened,
but it was easier and less confusing to narrate what I *should* have done instead.
For that reason the photos don't quite match the description.

I started by countersinking the fastener holes in the top of the base. I actually
drilled the countersinks a bit deeper than I normally would for reasons that
should be clear in a minute. Then I applied 2 layers of low viscosity epoxy using rubber
stoppers to keep the fastener holes reasonably clean.

Next I took a piece of reasonably fair plywood, coated it with plastic shipping 
tape, and set it level with shims and the level app on my iPhone.

![level surface](images/level-epoxy-surface-web.jpg "A fair surface, levelled with shims and an iPhone, covered with plastic tape to resist epoxy")

It turns out the top of the winch block is just slightly smaller in diameter than
the top of a quart-sized yogurt container. This made a good perimeter
to contain a pool of unthickened epoxy and keep it from running until it
got slightly green (I cut the center out leaving just the rim).

![epoxy mold](images/mold-on-plywood-web.jpg "The plastic rim from a yogurt container keeps the epoxy from running over the plywood surface")

I calculated how much epoxy would be needed to fill the perimeter to a depth of
about 1/10", mixed up that amount, poured it into the yogurt container rim and
waited until the epoxy started to become thick and a bit "green. This only took about 20 minutes
since I was using "fast cure" or winter hardener. I kept a bit of residual epoxy
in the mix cup to swirl around to estimate how the epoxy pool on the plywood was doing.

Once the epoxy had thickened, I removed the yogurt container rim, set the winch
block firmly upside down in the pool of epoxy, and let it cure overnight.

Here is what it looked like the next morning. The last step was to sand or
cut off the edges, and redrill the countersink holes. Because I drilled the
first set of countersinks a bit deeper than I normally would have, I could
drill final ones without cutting all the way through to the mahogany,
and the countersinks would remain fully sealed.

## Finishing Up ##

That's nearly it for the winch blocks. To finish up, I just did some finish
sanding and cleaned all the surfaces well with acetone, and applied 2 coats
of penetrating epoxy. Prior to the epoxy coasts, I countersunk the fastener holes on the top of
each jib winch block as I plan to seal the winches to the blocks with butyl
tape. Of course, these will need several coats of varnish before they go
into service, but already they look quite a bit better compared to that
first picture.
