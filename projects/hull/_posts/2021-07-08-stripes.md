title: Boot and Cove Stripes
---

The stripes presented a bunch of new technical challenges that I had never faced
before: marking consistent width stripes, masking, brush techniques, the ornamental
arrow and fins on the cove stripe, and whether it was better to just go
with vinyl striping instead.

Before, doing anything on the hull, I spent
a lot of time testing different options on the test board mentioned previously,
which I primed, painted and sanded back at least three times. I also created
a [template][appendix] for the arrow tip and fin in a drawing program,
which I printed on 1/4" plywood on a friend's CNC router so I could trace these
onto the hull. Initially, what worked best for me was to mask off the ends of
the cove stripe, use the template to trace each shape in place, and carefully cut out
each shape with a sharp Exacto blade. I used a short metal straight edge for the
lines and free-handed the curves. It worked surprisingly well but was extremely delicate,
and I worried about screwing up the decorations on the hull. In the end,
I discovered that I could send the same computer artwork to [BoatUS](https://www.boatus.com/products-and-services/boat-lettering)
who could reproduce the ornaments exactly for a very reasonable price.
The forest green matched my paint so closely I couldn't tell the difference
from more than a few feet away. I decided to paint the boot stripe and the long
section of the cove stripe and add use vinyl decals for the ornamental tips.

Alexseal strongly recommended gray primer underneath the dark forest green I had
chosen for the cove and racing stripes. That meant that each
stripe would need to be taped off four times: once to sand, once to apply primer,
a third time to sand the primer, and a fourth for the topcoats (removing the tape
after sanding is highly recommended). For the sanding coats I used frog tape from
the hardware store; for the primer and topcoat I used 3M's Fine Line 218.

### Cove Stripes ###

The cove stripe was challenging because on the Seabreeze the hull is recessed beneath
the stripe (and the ornaments) although on my hull the recess had suffered quite a bit
of loss due sanding and resurfacing (both mine and previous renovations). But from what
I could tell, the original cove stripe was about 3/4" with round endcaps. The distance
from the deck to the top of the stripe was 3.5" for most of the hull except for the
final four feet at the bow where it gradually tapered away from the deck to a final
distance of 4". Some of this may have been due to the
[reshaping of the deck-hull joint](2019-03-29-deck-preparation.html)
we did as part of the toerail renovation.

What worked for me was to mark a 3/4" width with masking tape on an adjustable square
which I laid on the deck and marked the hull at 12-16" intervals.

Then I masked off the top and bottom of the stripe, and cut a semi-circle out of the end
with an Exacto blade (I used my plywood template, but 3/4" diameter circle of any kind
would have sufficed). Then I sanded the area with 320 grit Abranet, trying as best I could
to sand up to and over the edge of the tape.

After sanding, I removed the tape, wiped down the cove stripe well--by this time I had switched
to Alexseal's Wipe Down Solvent--and remasked the stripe with 3M Fine Line tape. Although
I decided to do the ornaments with decals, the plywood template was still helpful to make sure
I cut the semi-circle endcap in the right location.

For the primer: I started out using a 1" foam brush (solvent resistant) but found it didn't hold
up well after about 10 minutes. Instead, I ended up going back to the 4" Redtree rollers and loading
up the roller as little as possible. I also added a layer of "safety tape" above and below the
Fine Line tape. Even with tiny, vertical roller strokes, I got more even coverage and flow than with a foam brush
and could apply the primer more quickly. While I wasn't sure if this would work as well for the topcoat
(because it would risk overworking the paint), it
allowed me to finish each primer coat in just a few minutes. I put on two coats at 90 minute intervals on
an 85 degree day.

### Boot Stripe ###

The challenge in marking a boot stripe is that you must compensate for the curve of the hull to paint a stripe
that looks even over its entire length. That means the stripe must be wider at the bow and stern than at midship.
There are several techniques for doing this, but I ended up developing my own measurement jig, which works
if you have already established the waterline. In my case the waterline was already well marked by the border
of the bottom paint.

The jig consists of a dead-flat surface---I used alumimum plate---with a level bubble attached;
a good-sized level would have also sufficed. I had determined that I wanted my boot stripe to be 2 1/4" at mid ship
so I cut a block to that width. Then I placed the edge of the aluminum plate against the waterline, adjusted its
angle until the bubble indicated it was level, slid the block against the hull and marked the top
of the block with a pencil.  I did this at 12-16" intervals. As the curve of the hull became more pronounced,
the boot stripe height increased.  The Seabreeze's LWL/LOA ratio is small by today's
standards so the height at the bow was close to 4" and under the transom it was over 6".

**Note:** it's quite likely that boats on the hard are not perfectly level port to starboard, which means
that this technique would render slightly different height stripes for each side. I corrected for this by
first placing the level on the cockpit sole to get a "dead level" reading for the boat itself, and
marked that position on the bubble.
