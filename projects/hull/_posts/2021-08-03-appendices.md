### Estimated Timeline ###

*Note: except for priming and painting I did most of this project working 1-2 days per week concurrent
with other projects both both-related and otherwise. The estimated
dates are based on timestamps in the photos I took. Unfortunately
I did not keep track of actual days worked. I would roughly estimate this project at 35-40 working days
including the repeated final coat but excluding construction and disassembly of the enclosure.*
