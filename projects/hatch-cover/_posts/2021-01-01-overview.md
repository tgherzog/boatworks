This project sort of started as a mole hill and turned into a mouuntain. Initially,
I just wanted to repaint the underside of my front hatch. Then I decided to try to
sand off the existing paint and fair the exterior surface. That's when I discovered
the hatch had badly deliminated and concluded it was beyond repair. With encouragement
from [Sonny](http://coldwaterdesign.com/llc/) and following a [tutorial from
Boatworks Today](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaMi2YBMZ8w) I decided to make a
replacement fiberglass hatch from a mold. NB: unlike Andy I used epoxy instead of polyester
resin.

This was the first project of this kind for me, and despite the encouragement and
tutorials I wasn't very sure of myself. So before starting on the final project I built
a half-size "mini" hatch composed of just two layers of cloth. This practice project
really helped me work out how to build the mold and give me confidence that the hatch
actually would "pop" out of the mold when finished.
