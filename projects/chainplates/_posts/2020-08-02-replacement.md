title: Replacement and Installation
---

Every boat is different, and I'm sure the process of installing
and sealing the chain plates is different for everyone, but here's what worked for me.

My first step was to Dremel out the screw holes that held the chain plate covers
in place and fill them with fresh epoxy. If your fiberglass is thick enough you can just bore out the old hole
with a grinding bit, but you might also opt to drill all the way through the deck.
In the latter case, you'll need to tape the bottom of the hole so the epoxy doesn't 
drip into the cabin. Plastic syringes like the kind you use to give medicine to pets are nice
tools for filling these little holes; a swizzle stick as a sort of mini-spatula also works well.

The next step is to reinstall the chain plates. Depending on the location, this can be much
easier said than done.

That's it for today. I want to allow the epoxy to cure overnight before drilling pilot holes
and installing the chain plate covers. There's a tropical storm coming up the coast, so I'd really
like to have the stays back in place, even without the covers. I reattach them, temporarily seal the deck with hardware-store
grade butyl and wrap up for the day.

After the epoxy has fully cured I can finish the installation. I've seen a couple different ways to do this,
but what works for me is to simply drill very thin pilot holes with a Dremel and a 1/32" drill bit. 1/16" or larger
is already too big, and the screws that hold the chain plate covers in place end up stripping (I tested this in my
workshop). The chain plate cover itself needs to serve as a guide, so temporarily tack it in place with a bit of
(what else?) butyl tape so it doesn't slide around while you drill the holes.

Next, it's time to apply the butyl tape, both to the bottom of the chain plate cover and the area around the
chain plate itself. The butyl tape will want to stick more to your fingers than to the metal; an easy fix for this
is to use the wax paper to press the butyl  in place. I try to get the tape as flat as possible and cover the entire
area of the bottom of the chain plate cover, but provide plenty of sealant around the chain plate.

Next, thread the screws into place and through the butyl tape on the bottom of the chain plate cover, and start to turn the screws
into the pilot holes, but don't tighten them down yet. Then reattach the turnbuckle to the chain plate and tighten it back to its original
position (you recorded that with calipers when you first started, right?). This may be just me, but it makes sense that the chain plates 
be sealed while they are under at least some load to avoid stretching the seal later. Don't forget to reinstall the turnbuckle covers
if you have them.

Finally, screw in the fastener screws, applying a few turns to each screw in sequence so the plate tightens down evenly across all four corners.
The butyl tape will start to seep out of the seems (and will continue to do so over several days), and in your leisure time you can cut away the excess
with a plastic putty knife or other soft but stiff edge.
