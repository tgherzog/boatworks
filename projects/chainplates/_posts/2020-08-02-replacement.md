title: Replacement and Installation
---

Every boat is different, and I'm sure the process of installing
and sealing the chain plates is different for everyone, but here's what worked for me.

My first step was to Dremel out the screw holes that held the chain plate covers
in place and fill them with fresh epoxy. If your fiberglass is thick enough you can just bore out the old hole
with a grinding bit, but you might also opt to drill all the way through the deck.
In the latter case, you'll need to tape the bottom of the hole so the epoxy doesn't 
drip into the cabin. Plastic syringes like the kind you use to give medicine to pets are nice
tools for filling these little holes; a swizzle stick also works well.

The next step is to reinstall the chain plates. Depending on the location, this can be much
easier said than done.

That's it for today. I want to allow the epoxy to cure overnight before drilling pilot holes
and installing the chain plate covers. There's a tropical storm coming up the coast, so I'd really
like to have the stays back in place, even without the covers. I reattach them, temporarily seal the deck with hardware-store
grade butyl and wrap up for the day.

After the epoxy has fully cured I can finish the installation. I've seen a couple different ways to do this,
but what works for me is to simply drill very thin pilot holes with a Dremel and a 1/32" drill bit. 1/16" or larger
is already too big, and the screws that hold the chain plate covers in place end up stripping (I tested this in my
workshop).

I like to partially put in the screws as I go to help keep the chain plate in place.
