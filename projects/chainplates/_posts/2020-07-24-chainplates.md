My chain plates have started to leak badly, so it's time to rebed them. This process closely follows Tom Keffer's
[excellent project log on treefools.org](http://www.threefools.org/velocity/Projects/RebedChainplates/chainplates.html)
with a few interesting twists.

I've been using [Bed-It Butyl Tape](https://shop.marinehowto.com/products/bed-it-tape) for my bedding projects
and highly recommend it. Bed-It is formulated specifically for marine environments, is slightly lighter in color
(but still gray) than the stuff you might find at the hardware store, and is rolled relatively thin, which I find
easier for bedding applications. I can imagine very few bedding applications where I'd go back to the 4000 I was
using before. Don Casey has a [great overview](https://www.boatus.com/magazine/2013/april/how-to-pick-the-right-sealant.asp)
on different types of sealants if you're interested.


## Starting out

My [Allied Seabreeze](http://www.alliedseabreeze35.org) has 1 upper and 2 lower shrouds per side for a total of 6 chain plates. I gave quite
a bit of thought to the most efficient strategy for this project. The ideal of course, would be to unstep
the mast and rebed all 6 chain plates at once, but for me that wasn't feasible. On the other hand, doing them
one at a time would add a lot of time to the project since I live about an hour's drive from the boat yard.
I didn't like the idea of removing more than 2 plates at a time. So in the end, I worked in stages: lower
shrouds on the starboard side, upper shroud once the lower ones were reattached, then repeat on port side.

Except where noted, the pictures here are taken on the port side, by which I'm I'd already completed the
starboard side. You may also notice that the toe rails are missing. At this point, they are in the process of
[being replaced][toerails].

**Step 1:** I tied my 2 halyards to the nearest cleats or stanchions to steady the side I was working on 
and winched these down as tight as I could.

**Step 2:** I measured and recorded the distance of my turnbuckle bolts before loosening them. Assuming
your rig is reasonably tuned, this is important so you can restore it to its original state.

**Step 3:** Loosen the turnbuckle and remove the pin attaching it to the chain plate. Use crescent wrenches
for this; do not use a screwdriver, which stresses the turnbuckle. Remove the pin on the opposite end that
attaches the turnbuckle to the shroud and lash the shroud(s) to the mast.

**Note:** try to keep the parts of each turnbuckle and chainplate assembly together as you remove them and label
them with tape. In my rig each chain plate, backing plate and corresponding set of fastener bolts are all different.
This will save a lot of time and guess work down the road.
{: .note :}

**Step 4:** Remove the fastener screws on the chain plate covers. These will easily get lost, so have a cup or an
old vitamin bottle ready to hold them. You might also consider replacing these with new hardware as the heads can
get damaged.

**Step 5:** Patiently work loose the chain plate covers and remove them. Unless you don't mind wrecking your deck
paint this requires quite a bit of patience. I used the thinnest paint scraper I could find to slowly and gently
break through the old (4000) sealant and avoid as much as possible scraping into the paint. Also avoid putting
to much pressure on the cover itself until the sealant has lost its hold. Even stainless covers will bend if
they are thin, and will need to be reflattened again later.

Once the cover is removed you can take these home and remove all the old sealant and other crud however you like.
Here you can see I once attempted to temporarily seal this chain plate from above with silicone: a poor decision I won't repeat :)

"This chain plate got a bit bent on removal and will need to be flattened before I put it back on")

**Step 6:** Time to remove the chain plate. This of course needs to be done from within the cabin and typically means
partially reorganizing and possibly disassembling stuff in your living quarters. In my case, I'd already done this as part
of the [toerail progject][toerails] so it was no big deal. Otherwise, this can be a major hassle.

This step of the project can be notoriously difficult. On the Seabreeze the chain plates were originally
[glassed to the hull](http://www.alliedseabreeze35.org/files/Download/Chainplates.pdf) making inspection much less removal
a daunting task. Even then, chain plates are often difficult to reach, and removing them involves work in cramped conditions at 
odd angles. I consider myself very lucky. On my boat the chain plates appear to have already been replaced with 316 stainless steel
at one point, and the glass was removed to do so.  It was a relatively easy (but still arduous) matter of removing the 3 bolts holding
each plate in place.

Again, keep track of your hardware and keep each assembly together if you can. Be sure to note which side of the chain plate faces the
bulkhead or whatever it is mounted to. There's a good chance that if you try later to install it backwards or mix up your plates, things
won't fit.

**Step 7:** Remove remaining sealant from the deck, chain plate and hardware. 4000 comes off easily enough with a paint scraper and
perhaps a bit of fine sandpaper. Looking at the deck it becomes obvious that a previous owner
replaced the chain plates at some point; those holes look a bit nasty.
However, with the chain plate in place it's actually not too bad, at least on the
port side. So I don't think I'll do much to repair the holes in this case. The starboard side, which I did previously, was another
matter (see next page).

![hole with chain plate suspended](images/hole-with-chainplate-web.jpg "The hole looks like it was cut with a chain saw, but with the chain plate in place there's actually not an unacceptable amount of space")

After repeating these steps for the other lower shroud on the port side, that's enough for one day. I cut a temporary cap from some old
plywood and afixed it over the chain plate holes with hardware store grade butyl tape to prevent rain from getting in until I could
return later.

**TODO: add picture of temporary cap**

Back at home, I cleaned up the chain plates and covers, removed old sealant and tarnish, etc. This is an excellent time to inspect
the chain plates and fasteners for damage and make replacements as necessary. I'm always surprised at how far a 3M ScotchBrite pad and
water will go in cleaning up metal parts. If that doesn't do it then I add a bit of an oxalic acid-based cleaner such as Bar Keepers Friend.
Perfection isn't necessary; I only need to clean the parts enough to expose possible failure points. But a good shine always looks nice
anyway. I also disassembled the turnbuckles and quickly cleaned everything with a ScotchBrite pad; for some reason the bolts got rather dirty.
