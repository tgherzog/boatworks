title: Fixing my Chainplate Holes
---


While the chain plate cutouts through the deck were reasonably snug on the port side, for whatever
reason the ones on the starboard side were another matter. There were major gaps all around the chain
plate, too much to reasonably fill with butyl tape or any other sealant. No wonder they were leaking!

Time to break out the epoxy. I've recently been fixing a lot of cosmetic dings using the
[no blush epoxies](https://www.epoxyusa.com/category_s/3.htm) that Paul Oman sells. Really great stuff.
For this job I used the winter cure hardener thickened with fumed silica. Normally the winter cure
isn't recommended above 50 degrees or so, and the temperature this day was nearly 80. But since I'm
making a very small batch and as long as I work very quickly (I'll only have a few minutes),
I can get away with it, and it will fully cure within a couple of hours.
If that's living too dangerously for you, use the standard or the summer cure.

Normally filling a deck hole of this size with epoxy would be fairly straight forward. The challenge
here is that I need to somehow leave a cutout for the chain plate. If I fill the hole in completely
then I'd just have to drill and file out space for the chain plate, based largely on guess work,
and I might not be any better off than when I started.

My solution was to cut a plug out of XPS foam to create a cutout for the chain plate. XPS foam is used
for insulation and can be bought at most hardware stores. A friend had some scraps so I didn't
have to buy a 4x8' sheet. It turns out the 1.5" thick sheets were exactly the width of the my chain
plates! So I rough cut some approximately 1/4" slabs with a hobby knife and sanded them down until
the thickness matched that of my chain plates.

**Note:** do not use styrofoam for this; it will disintegrate when it comes in contact with the epoxy.

The next challenge is to get the cutout properly positioned in the middle of the opening. If the hole is small
you can probably just eyeball the cutout's location. But if the hole is
especially large you risk putting the cutout in the wrong place or twisting it out of alignment.
The best way to get the right position is to temporarily bolt the chain plate back in place and mark its 
position with a shim or small ruler.  After the chain plate is removed, the shim provides a guide for correctly positioning the cutout.

Then I sealed the hole from beneath with painter's tape or duct tape. 
That keeps the epoxy from running through
the opening into the cabin and provides a base for the cutout to rest upon and stick to. Back on deck, I placed
the cutout in the hole using the position guide made sure it stuck to the duct tape underneath to hold it
in place, and removed the guide.

Next, I mixed up my epoxy using fumed silica to get to a peanut butter thickness. It's important to make sure the cutout remains fairly straight
in the hole as the epoxy is flowed in.

Once the epoxy has fully cured simply cut the foam out with any sharp object and lightly file away any remaining
bits.

Finally, I cut a slight countersink bevel around the hole with a Dremel.

Here is the final result with the chain plate in place (I had not yet cut bevel at this point).
